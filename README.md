# PyTorch: Tensors and Dynamic Neural Networks in Python

**PyTorch** is a leading open-source machine learning framework that supports rapid research, prototyping, and seamless production deployment. Built with a Python-first mindset, PyTorch offers dynamic computation graphs, a strong developer community, and an ecosystem of powerful libraries.

This `README.md` provides an overview of PyTorch, including key features, installation instructions, getting started examples, documentation links, and contribution guidelines.

## Key Features

PyTorch offers a rich set of features tailored to deep learning and AI development:

- ** Pythonic & Intuitive: ** Designed to feel native to Python, PyTorch integrates smoothly with the broader Python data science ecosystem.
- ** Dynamic Computational Graphs: ** Leverage native control flow like loops and conditionals with `autograd`, enabling flexible and readable model definitions.
- ** Distributed Training: ** Train at scale using `torch.distributed`, which supports multi-GPU and multi-machine setups efficiently.
- ** Ecosystem of Libraries: ** Includes high-level domain libraries like:
  - `torchvision` (vision),
  - `torchtext` (NLP),
  - `torchaudio` (audio), and more.
- **ðŸ“¦ Production-Ready: ** Export models using `TorchScript` for high-performance inference in production environments (including C++ runtimes).

## Installation

Install PyTorch via `pip` or `conda`. For detailed setup instructions tailored to your system and environment, refer to the [official installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### Quick Install with pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Getting Started

Hereâ€™s a basic example demonstrating tensor operations and CUDA support:

```
import torch

# Create a random tensor
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print("Random tensor:\n", x)

# Create a zero tensor of type long
y = torch.zeros(5, 3, dtype=torch.long)
print("\nZero tensor:\n", y)

# Add the two tensors
z = x + y
print("\nSum:\n", z)

# Move tensors to GPU if available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    x = x.to(device)
    y = y.to(device)
    z = x + y
    print("\nSum on GPU:\n", z)
```
