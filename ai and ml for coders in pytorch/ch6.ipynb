    "### Chapter 6. Making Sentiment Programmable by Using Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embeddings:** These are high-dimensional vectors that represent words. Each word is mapped to a vector, and the direction of these vectors is learned from how the words are used in a given text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence Sentiment:** When you have a sentence, you can sum the vectors of the words it contains. The overall direction of this sum can help the model determine the sentiment of the sentence, which is a function of its individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Positioning:** The positioning of words in the sentence can also influence the embedding, making the model more accurate over time."
